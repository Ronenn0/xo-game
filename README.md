# XO Game – Tic‑Tac‑Toe ❌⭕️

This is a classic **Tic‑Tac‑Toe (XO)** game that I built in **2020**, before my military service. It was one of my first hands-on logic projects using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, created completely from scratch without tutorials.

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
xo-game/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Writing game logic from scratch (turns, win/tie detection)
- Working with arrays and game state
- DOM manipulation for marking and feedback
- Basic styling and layout with CSS
- Structuring early JavaScript projects clearly

## 🗒️ Background

I created this game while learning to code on my own, long before any formal courses or training. No frameworks, no guides — just pure practice and logic.

It helped me build confidence in programming and was one of the first projects where I saw code come to life interactively.

## ✅ Project Status

✅ Fully working  
⚠️ Not responsive / mobile-optimized  
🧪 Early-stage coding style (raw but functional)
